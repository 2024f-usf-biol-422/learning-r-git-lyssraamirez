## Project description
In this project, we analyze a dataset of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms to 
investigate genetic variation in multiple genome samples. The analysis focuses 
on extracting data from a specific sample, visualizing SNP quality scores, and
generating different types of  figures to demonstrate the results of each
genome.
