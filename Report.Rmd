## Setup

```{r Setup-chunk}
snp_data <- "data/sample_snp_data.csv"
sample_id <- "SRR12433063"
```

```{r Load necessary packages}
# Load required libraries and source the function
library(ggplot2)
source("code/functions/SNP_analyzation.R")
```

## Project description
In this project, we analyze a dataset of single nucleotide polymorphisms to 
investigate genetic variation in multiple genome samples. The analysis focuses 
on extracting data from a specific sample, visualizing SNP quality scores, and
generating different types of figures to demonstrate the results of each
genome.
