# SNP Data Analysis Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data using a dynamic
and reproducible  in R. The report is generated using RMarkdown and includes 
custom functions, visualizations, and exported data. The  is designed to 
dynamically update for different sample IDs, making it easy to repeat analyses
for various samples.
