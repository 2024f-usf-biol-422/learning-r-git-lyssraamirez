## Project description
In this project, we analyze a data set of single nucleotide polymorphisms to 
investigate genetic variation in multiple genome samples. The analysis focuses 
on extracting data from a specific sample, visualizing SNP quality scores, and
generating different types of figures to demonstrate the results of each
genome. In Figure one chromosome position is on the x and quality score is on 
y."Ggplot2" [@wickham2016ggplot2] was used to execute a accurate visual box plot and scatter plot.
The data in these graphs was subset from a large set of SNP samples, "dplyr"[@wickham2023dplyr] 
was used to manipulate the data from the original data frame. To accurately 
apply references and citations to support the figures "citr" [@rstudio2023citr] was used to cite 
R packages.After the "Report.Rmd" file was completed it was kitted using [@xie2023knitr] to configure a "Report.html" output report. Chat GPT [@openai2023chatgpt] was also used as a reference in code of figures.

## Subsetting data
```{r subet-data}
# Pass only the SNP_file and sample_id arguments

single_sample_data <- subset_snp_data(file_path = params$snp_file,
                                      sample_id = params$sample_id)
# Create a csv file for subset data
output_file <- paste0("data/subset_snp_data", params$sample_id, ".csv")
write.csv(single_sample_data, file = output_file, row.names = FALSE)

# Confirmation message
cat("subset file saved as:", output_file)
```

## Figures
```{r snp-scatterplot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Scatterplot of SNP quality scores
scatter_plot <- ggplot(single_sample_data, aes(x = pos, y = qual)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
       title = paste("SNP quality scores by position for sample", 
                     params$sample_id),
       x = "Position in Genome",
       y = "SNP Quality Score") +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the scatterplot
ggsave(filename = paste0("output/scatter_plot", params$sample_id, ".png"),
       plot = scatter_plot, width = 8, height = 6)

# Display the plot
scatter_plot
```

**Figure 1.** Scatterplot of SNP quality scores by genome position for sample SRR12433063. This figure shows the relationship between distribution of SNP quality scores across the genome, with each point representing a specific SNP position and its associated quality score.

```{r figues-boxplot-}
# Boxplot of SNP Quality Scores by Position Category (e.g., grouped by bins)
boxplot_plot <- ggplot(single_sample_data, aes(x = factor(pos %/% 1000),
                                               y = qual)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue", color = "black", outlier.colour = "red",
               outlier.shape = 16) +
  labs(
    title = paste("Boxplot of SNP Quality Scores for Sample",
                  params$sample_id),
    x = "Position in Genome (in bins of 1000)",
    y = "SNP Quality Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
# Save the box plot to a PNG file
ggsave(filename = paste0("output/box_plot_", params$sample_id, ".png"),
       plot = boxplot_plot, width = 8, height = 6)

# Display the boxplot

**Figure 2.** Boxplot of SNP quality scores by genome position for sample SRR12433063. This figure shows the relationship between distribution of SNP quality scores across the genome and its associated quality score.
