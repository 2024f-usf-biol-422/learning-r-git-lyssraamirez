#project description
This project is an analysis of the SARS-CoV2 snps."snps" are single nucleotide polymorphisms, which are variations in the DNA sequence of the genome. These variations can be used to track the evolution and spread of the virus. Data found can help deter the spread of the virus and help future pandemics from occuring.
